# What I'm Learning Now

I am a data analyst currently focusing my learning on these things:

* **Excel** - being relatively new to Excel and use it daily for work. My learning goal to perform analysis more efficiently.
* **Data Visualization** - focusing on how craft the story after analysis. Primarily using Excel Dashboards and Charts. I'm also keen on learning D3 for fun.
* **Finance** - The recent Gamestop ($GME) situation helped me understand [how Options work](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/options-knowledge-center/). The long term goal is to have a good understanding of topics covered in a CFA level I exam.

These are my learning priorities right now.
